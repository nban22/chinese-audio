# chinese-audio

**chinese-audio** is a web application designed for learning Chinese through audio exercises. This project combines modern web technologies to create a full-stack application with a React frontend, an Express backend, and a MySQL database powered by Sequelize ORM.

## Project Structure

- **Frontend (React)**: The user interface is built with React to provide a responsive and interactive experience for audio learning, practice, and progress tracking.
- **Backend (Express)**: An Express server handles API requests, authentication, and the business logic for managing audio content and user data.
- **Database (MySQL + Sequelize)**: Data storage is managed using MySQL with Sequelize as the ORM for efficient data modeling and querying.

## Features

- **Audio Content**: Users can access, listen to, and repeat audio exercises designed to improve pronunciation and comprehension.
- **User Management**: User authentication and profile management ensure personalized learning experiences.
- **Progress Tracking**: Track users' learning progress with database entries that store session data.
- **Seamless Communication**: The React frontend and Express backend communicate through RESTful APIs for smooth data transfer.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**:
  - React (with modern hooks and state management)
  - Axios for API requests
  - React Router for navigation

- **Backend**:
  - Express.js for server-side routing and API creation
  - Node.js for runtime

- **Database**:
  - MySQL for data storage
  - Sequelize ORM for database management and query building

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chinese-audio.git
   cd chinese-audio
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

     ```
   - Backend:
     ```bash
     cd server
     npm install
     ```

3. **Set up the database**:
   - Ensure MySQL is installed and running.
   - Create a `.env` file in the server directory with database connection details.
   - Run Sequelize migrations:
     ```bash
     npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
     ```

4. **Run the development servers**:
   - Start the backend:
     ```bash
     cd server
